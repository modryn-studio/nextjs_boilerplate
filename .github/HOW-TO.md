# Copilot Setup — How To Use

> Get live fast. Track before you build. Distribute before you polish. One killer feature, not ten mediocre ones.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

One-time setup. Run these in order when starting a new project.

1. Create a blank repo on GitHub
2. Create a project folder locally and clone this boilerplate into it:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/modryn-studio/nextjs_boilerplate [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
   cd [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
   ```
3. Reset the git history and point to the new repo (this gives you a clean 1-commit start — cloning brings all boilerplate history along otherwise):
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
   git init -b main
   git add -A
   git commit -m "init"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/modryn-studio/YOUR-REPO
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Run `npm install`
5. **Discovery** — two paths:
   - **Starting from scratch** → Open chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`), select **Agent** mode, pick **@prebuild**. Describe the idea. It researches, validates, and fills `context.md` + `brand.md` when you say "fill it in."
   - **Docs already written** → Drop your pre-filled `context.md` and `brand.md` into the project root, replacing the stubs.
6. Run `/validate` — web-searches competitors, user pain, SEO opportunity, and brand positioning. Go back and forth. Update `context.md` and `brand.md` based on findings.
7. Type `/setup` — reads source docs, fills in `copilot-instructions.md` + `src/config/site.ts`. Start the dev server (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and check the basic landing page in your browser.
8. Create or drop your logomark at `public/brand/logomark.png`. The file must be 1024×1024 — use ImageMagick to pad if needed: `magick logomark.png -gravity center -background none -extent 1024x1024 logomark.png`
9. Run `/assets` — generates all favicons, icons, and banner. Push to `main`. Then verify the favicon shows up in the browser tab.
10. Run `/deps` — validates all dependencies against live docs, surfaces breaking API changes.

> After setup, **never edit `copilot-instructions.md` or `site.ts` directly**. Edit the source docs → run `/update`.

---

## Phase 2: Go Live

Get a URL as fast as possible. A live site — even a landing page — is worth more than a perfect local prototype. It unlocks tracking, distribution, and public accountability.

**Build your public footprint first:**

1. Run `/tool` — registers the tool on modrynstudio.com with `status: "building"`. Merge the PR right away.
2. Run `/log` — first build log post. Document the idea, the origin, the plan. Merge the PR.
3. **If there's a paid tier planned: add a founding member price now.** Email = curiosity. Pre-order = validation. Even $4.99 proves someone will exchange money, not just attention. Wire Stripe checkout before the core product exists and link it from the hero CTA. Worst case: zero buyers and you learned something before writing a line of core product code. (Paul Buchheit to YC founders: "Go sell the product ASAP before wasting time building it.")
4. **Once you have 5+ pre-orders or serious signups: schedule calls.** Don't wait until launch. One 20-minute call with a real buyer reveals more than 100 passive signups. Ask: what's their current system, what have they tried, what made them act? The real product core surfaces here — not from what you planned to build.

> `/tool` only needs `status: "building"` — you don't need a live product URL yet. Every day the listing exists is a day Google can index it. Every log post is content that compounds.

**Deploy — two paths based on your deployment mode:**

- **Standalone domain** (the product earns its own brand) →
  1. Purchase domain
  2. Deploy to Vercel (Pro plan if commercial — Hobby prohibits charging money)
  3. Point DNS to Vercel
  4. Set `mode: standalone-domain` and `url:` in `context.md` → run `/update`

- **Subdirectory on modrynstudio.com** (default for most tools) →
  1. Deploy to Vercel (note the `.vercel.app` URL) — **this includes a landing page. You don't need a finished product. Any live page at the Vercel URL is enough.**
  2. Switch back to **modryn-studio-v2** in VS Code
  3. Run `/deploy` — adds the rewrite wiring `modrynstudio.com/tools/[slug]/*` → your Vercel URL
  4. Set `mode: modryn-app` and `url:` in `context.md` → run `/update`

  > `status: "building"` + active rewrite is the standard state while the product is in development. The rewrite stays in `next.config.ts` throughout — when the real product ships, it replaces the landing page at the same Vercel URL and the rewrite keeps working with no changes needed in modryn-studio-v2.

---

## Phase 3: Instrument & Distribute

You have a live URL. Now wire tracking and do your first distribution push before building the core product. This is counterintuitive but critical — you want data from day one.

1. Run `/seo` — generates missing SEO files, audits the codebase, walks through Search Console + Bing setup. Needs a live URL.
2. Run `/launch` — distribution checklist. Fixes sharing hooks, social footer, OG tags, and share-on-X hooks.
3. Turn on **Vercel Analytics** — add `<Analytics />` to `layout.tsx` if not already present.
4. Run **`@check`** — quality gate on your setup. Scans for bugs, secrets, code issues → auto-fixes what it can → runs lint + build → commits fixes. Never pushes. Takes ~10 minutes — let it run.
5. Switch to **modryn-studio-v2** and run `/social` — generates launch copy (X, Reddit, shipordie) using v2 voice rules. Post on your networks.

> `/deploy` and `/social` are modryn-studio-v2 commands. They only work when modryn-studio-v2 is open in VS Code.

At this point you have: a live site, tracking, SEO filed, a public tool listing, a log post, and social distribution. All before writing a single line of core product code.

---

## Phase 4: Build the Core

Now build the one killer feature. Wire the complete flow end-to-end — from user input to delivered output. Not ten features. One.

### Minimum Money Loop

Wire the complete loop end-to-end before polishing any single piece. One real order through the whole system beats a perfect intake with no delivery.

Open `context.md` → find `## Minimum Money Loop` → keep it visible. Every build session, ask: _does this work advance the loop, or is it polish?_

**Default rule: the landing page and the video go live on the same day. This is not optional.**

The landing page is not polish — it is the demand test. The Modryn Loop validates with a pre-order page before the product is finished, not after. A live page with a $9 CTA and a same-day video is the instrument. The money loop closes after demand is proven, not before.

Sequence for every product:

1. Build the core deliverable surface (the recipient page, the output page — whatever the buyer sends to someone else)
2. Record the video per Ogilvy's script
3. Build the landing page with locked copy and $9 CTA
4. Go live — video posted and landing page live same day
5. Wire the money loop after 50 pre-orders confirm demand

**Exception — put output on the page first if you already have it:** If you have real examples of the finished result before the feature is built (audio samples, screenshots, a completed demo), add them to the landing page _before_ building the ordering flow. That's not polish — it's the conversion mechanism, and it can't wait. The rule is: don't build UI you don't need yet. Real output you already have is never wasted.

**The dev loop:**

- `Ctrl+Shift+B` — starts the dev server, pipes output to `dev.log`. Tell Copilot **"check logs"** at any point.
- Edit `context.md` or `brand.md` → run `/update` immediately. Skipping this means Copilot works off stale context.
- Run `/deps` if you're unsure whether a package is current.

**Before a major implementation:**

**Scan GitHub for reference implementations.** Before building any non-trivial feature — backend service, data pipeline, integration, complex UI pattern — spend 20 minutes reading 2-3 open-source repos that have solved a similar problem. You're not looking for code to copy. You're looking for patterns to borrow and mistakes to skip.

How to search: use `mcp_github_search_repositories` with short 2-3 word queries (multi-word phrases return zero results). Read the root directory listing, then `README.md` + the main entry file. That's usually enough to understand the architecture.

What to extract:

- **API / interface shape** — how do callers start a job, poll for progress, handle errors?
- **Data/state schema** — what does the data flowing through the system look like?
- **Core algorithm or pattern** — what's the non-obvious decision at the center of this thing?
- **What they skipped** — scope they punted on that you might need (or should also skip)

Drop your findings in a `docs/` note before writing a line of code. One file, bullet points. It becomes the implicit spec you build against.

To use it during a build session: drag the file into chat or type `#file:docs/your-reference.md` in your first message. It's research scaffolding — not a source doc, not maintained after the feature ships.

Run `/validate` with a focus area. The mechanics matter — this only works correctly in **Agent mode**:

1. Type `/validate` in the chat input — VS Code will show a dropdown suggesting the prompt. Select it so the prompt file actually loads.
2. In the **same message**, after the slash command, add your focus question.
3. Submit. The agent runs the full prompt file + your focus question with live web search.

Example messages:

- `/validate — validate my approach to the [feature] before I build it. Is this the right pattern for this user type?`
- `/validate — validate whether the pricing is still in the right range given what competitors are doing`
- `/validate — validate my plan to build [feature] next. What should I know about how competitors handle this?`

**If the output looks entirely offline** (no fetched URLs, no live competitor data cited): you're in Ask or Plan mode, not Agent mode. Switch to Agent and run again.

**When you're stuck:**

Getting stuck is normal. Here's the playbook:

1. **Research** — do competitor analysis. Screenshot their flows. Read their reviews. Share findings with Copilot.
2. **Revalidate** — run `/validate` focused on the area you're stuck on. "Validate my competitor positioning given what I found."
3. **Plan** — switch to **Plan** mode in chat. Hash out the architecture or approach before switching back to Agent to build.
4. **Roadmap** — share your research + ask Copilot for a mini roadmap. Implement one step at a time.

**After a major implementation:**

Run **`@check`** as a quality gate. Then push.

---

## Phase 5: Iterate

You have a working core feature. Now loop: ship → validate → distribute → repeat.

1. Run **`@check`** — quality gate after implementation.
2. Run `/polish` — UI consistency sweep. Ensures all interactive elements use shared primitives, brand tokens are applied consistently, responsive spacing is correct, mobile keyboard safety is wired, and touch targets meet minimums.
3. Run `/tool` — update the tool listing (flip status to `live` when ready). Merge the PR.
4. Run `/log` — document what you shipped. Each log post is content and distribution. Merge the PR.
5. Run `/social` (from modryn-studio-v2) if the milestone is worth announcing.
6. **Repeat Phase 4–5** until your first paying user.

**Milestones that earn a `/log` post:**

- Core feature working end-to-end
- First real order
- First stranger pays
- Major pivot or architecture decision
- Beta launch

**When to run `/validate` again:**

- Before adding a second feature (are you sure the first one is done?)
- After significant competitor research
- When your positioning or pricing might need to shift

> The goal of Phase 5 is not perfection — it's getting to one stranger paying and sharing the result. Everything else is noise.

## Quick Reference

### Reusable vs. One-Time Commands

| Command     | Frequency | What it does                                                                                                                                                          |

> **modryn-studio-v2 only:** `/deploy` and `/social` exist only in that repo. Switch workspaces to run them.

### `@check` — When to Run

`@check` is a quality gate, not a one-time step. Run it at transitions:

- **End of Phase 3** — setup clean before building features? (recommended)
- **After Phase 4 implementations** — ready for users? (required)
- **Before any push you're unsure about** — best practice
- **Takes ~10 minutes** — let it run, don't interrupt

> **Before running `@check`:** Switch the chat permissions picker to **Bypass Approvals** (bottom of the Chat view, next to the model selector). This lets `@check` auto-confirm file edits and terminal commands without interrupting for approval — which is exactly what it needs to run end-to-end. Switch back to Default Approvals when done.
>
> There's no way to set this programmatically — it's a per-session UI setting only. No frontmatter field, no hook, no command can trigger it. The step is: open Chat → switch to Bypass Approvals → invoke `@check`.

### `/validate` — Two Modes

1. **Setup validation** (Phase 1): "validate my market positioning" — broad, uses docs + web search
2. **Focused validation** (Phase 4+): "validate my competitor positioning and intake approach" — you tell it what to examine

### VS Code Modes

| Mode      | When to use                         | How                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Ask**   | Quick questions about your codebase | Chat → select "Ask"   |
| **Plan**  | Blueprint a feature before building | Chat → select "Plan"  |
| **Agent** | Build, edit files, run commands     | Chat → select "Agent" |

Open chat: `Ctrl+Alt+I`

### Brand Assets

Drop your logomark at `public/brand/logomark.png` (1024×1024, transparent background), then type `/assets`.

The script auto-detects whether your mark is colored or grayscale and generates the correct light/dark favicon pair.

**Optional overrides:**

- `public/brand/logomark-dark.png` — hand-crafted dark favicon (skips auto-inversion)
- `public/brand/banner.png` — 1280×320 README header (auto-generated if absent)

**What gets generated:**

| File                      | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public/favicon.svg`      | Primary favicon — embeds both PNGs, switches via `prefers-color-scheme` in the SVG |
| `public/icon-light.png`   | PNG fallback for browsers without SVG favicon support                              |
| `public/icon-dark.png`    | PNG fallback (dark variant)                                                        |
| `src/app/favicon.ico`     | Safari browser tab + legacy fallback — Next.js file convention                     |
| `src/app/icon.png`        | 1024×1024 — required for auto-generated webmanifest                                |
| `src/app/apple-icon.png`  | iOS "Add to Home Screen" — Next.js file convention                                 |
| `public/brand/banner.png` | README header (auto-generated if absent)                                           |

OG image is generated at build time by `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` — not a static file.

Or run directly (requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org)):

```powershell
.\scripts\generate-assets.ps1
```

### Hooks

**Format on Save** — files are auto-formatted with Prettier on save. Requires the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (VS Code will prompt). Rules in `.prettierrc`.

### Email Setup

Every project ships with a working email system out of the box. Two services, two jobs:

| Service                     | Job                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gmail SMTP (nodemailer)** | Founder notifications — you get an email when someone signs up, submits feedback, or files a bug |
| **Resend**                  | Audience management — signups are added to your shared Resend contact list, tagged by project    |

**What's included without any extra code:**

- `src/app/api/feedback/route.ts` — handles `newsletter`, `feedback`, and `bug` submissions. One route, all three.
- `src/components/email-signup.tsx` — ready-to-drop signup form. Calls the feedback route with `type: "newsletter"`.

**Env vars to set** (copy from `.env.local.example`):

```bash
GMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx   # Gmail app password — NOT your account password
FEEDBACK_TO=you@gmail.com               # Where founder notifications land (defaults to GMAIL_USER)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxx                  # Adds signups to your Resend audience
RESEND_SEGMENT_ID=                      # Optional — tags signups to a named segment in Resend
```

> **Gmail app password:** Go to myaccount.google.com → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords. Generate one for "Mail". Use that 16-character code, not your Gmail password.

**How the Resend audience works:**

All projects share one Resend account and one audience. Every signup is automatically tagged with `source: site.name` (e.g. `source: "My Project"`). Filter by `source` in the Resend dashboard to see signups per-project — no separate audiences or segments needed.

`RESEND_SEGMENT_ID` is optional. If you want signups from this project to appear in a named Resend segment (e.g. "My Project Waitlist"), create the segment at resend.com → Audience → Segments, copy its ID, and set this var. The code handles it automatically.

**The upgrade path — transactional email:**

The basic kit only handles founder notifications and contact list management. When a project needs to send emails _to users_ (order confirmations, delivery notifications, etc.), add:

1. `src/emails/your-template.tsx` — React Email template (`@react-email/components`)
2. A route that calls `resend.emails.send()` with that template
3. Fill in these two vars (already in `.env.local.example` as stubs):
   ```bash
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Your Project <hello@modrynstudio.com>  # modrynstudio.com is already verified in Resend
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com              # Used to build links inside emails
   ```
4. Install `@react-email/components` and `react-email`

> **Don't add a "you're signed up" confirmation email to the basic signup kit.** The inline success state already confirms it. A cold transactional email from a brand someone just discovered goes straight to spam and adds complexity for zero conversion benefit. Add it only when you have a specific reason — e.g. delivering a product, sending a magic link, or running a drip sequence.

> **Tip:** To debug why a prompt or instruction isn't loading, open the Agent Debug panel: `Command Palette → Developer: Open Agent Debug Panel`. Shows system prompts, tool calls, and every customization loaded for the session. You can also type `#debugEventsSnapshot` in chat to attach a live snapshot of agent debug events directly into your message — then ask Copilot to explain what's loaded, what's missing, or why something isn't firing. Faster than reading the raw panel logs.

> **Tip:** After any session where you corrected Copilot on a boilerplate pattern, type `/create-instruction` to turn those corrections into a persistent `.instructions.md` file. Save it to `.github/instructions/` so it travels with the boilerplate. For multi-step procedures (e.g. a fix workflow), `/create-skill` packages it as a reusable runbook instead.
